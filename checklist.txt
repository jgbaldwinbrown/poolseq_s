    1. calculate effective population size
X       1. get allele frequencies at each time point
X       2. get census pop size at each time point
X       3. calculate pop size over full time interval based on loss of heterozygosity
X       4. calculate eff pop size based on census pop size harmonic mean
        5. compare values, make sure they are reasonably close
    2. generate neutral simulation
X       1. get haplotypes of initial pop (known from indiv seq)
        2. run mimicree with known haplotypes and eff pop size
    3. calculate allele freq distribs based on neutral sim
        1. ~1000 replicates?
        2. for each polymorphic locus, calc allele freq for each replicate
        3. fit (gamma?) distrib to allele freqs
    4. compare actual allele freq to allele freq distrib, get p-value
    5. combine p-values using fisher's method
